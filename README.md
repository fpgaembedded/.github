# FPGA & Embedded Systems Exploration

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I document my journey in the interesting world of FPGAs and embedded systems. Motivated by the content of https://fpgaembedded.com/, this repository is a personal diary and eventually a place for those who would also find out more about that place where software and hardware meet.

## What's Inside

**FPGA Design Examples**: Use the following link to my existing collection of FPGA design examples in a variety of practical projects, from beginner to more complex designs, all showing the flexibility and power of FPGAs in a wide range of applications.

- **C/C++ Code Snippets**: My C/C++ code snippets further complete the FPGA designs. These were insights into the software side of things that focus on how software needs to integrate and communicate with FPGA designs, hence bridging the gap between software and hardware.

## Learning Journey

Each component of the code and sample in design feels like it reflects more understanding and growing appreciation for embedded systems and FPGAs. It represents not just the technical information but presents the creativity and problem-solving ability developed.

## Contribute & Learn Together

I would like to welcome you, encourage the reading of this repository, and even the contributing of new ideas and code of your own. Let's grow this into a community of enthusiasts who push the boundaries on what is possible with FPGAs and embedded systems. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to journeying together through the realms of FPGAs and embedded systems.
